# WPI Annotaion Analysis, Aggregation, and Removal
Research done in partnership with the Ying Wu College of Computing and Professor Martin Kellogg

Overarching research regarded analyzing AJava files and Java projects annotated with the WPI tool. Checking  nullness exceptions through annotation removal and compiling a list of hueristic design patterns to be later implemented in a smart annotaion removal system.

Final results concluded that the program files the WPI tool was "trained on," resulted in a level of code regidity, far above the skill level of an average programmer, resulting in necessary changes to the given input files.

My work on this project used a combination of JS, Java, Python, SciKit Learn, NumPy, Gradle Build Systems, Git and Bash Scripting
